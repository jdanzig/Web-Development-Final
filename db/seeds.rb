  {name: "Green Chile", description: "From Wikipedia: New Mexico chile is a cultivar of the chile pepper developed by Dr. Fabian Garcia at New Mexico State University in 1888, then known as Las Cruces College and the New Mexico College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts, created from a hybrid of various Pueblo and Santa Fe de Nuevo México cultivars. The New Mexican type chile grows best in the climate of its heritage, and is a key component in New Mexican cuisine, these peppers are so ubiquitous in New Mexico that the term chile is used, usually as fresh green chile or the ripened red chile. The New Mexico chile pepper is also popular in the broader Mexican cuisine and the cuisine of the Southwestern United States.", picture_file_name: "greenpods1.jpg", picture_content_type: "image/jpeg", picture_file_size: 15548, picture_updated_at: "2015-05-07 07:30:43"},
  {name: "Onion", description: "From Wikipedia: The onion (Allium cepa L.) (Latin 'cepa' = onion), also known as the bulb onion or common onion, is used as a vegetable and is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium. This genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food, such as the Japanese bunching onion (A. fistulosum), the Egyptian onion (A. ×proliferum), and the Canada onion (A. canadense). The name \"wild onion\" is applied to a number of Allium species but A. cepa is exclusively known from cultivation and its ancestral wild original form is not known, although escapes from cultivation have become established in some regions.[2] The onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant, but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season.", picture_file_name: "onion430x300.jpg", picture_content_type: "image/jpeg", picture_file_size: 25319, picture_updated_at: "2015-05-07 07:31:48"},
  {name: "Jalapeño", description: "From Wikipedia: The jalapeño is a medium-sized chili pepper. A mature jalapeño fruit is 5–10 cm (2–4 in) long, and is commonly picked and consumed while still green, but occasionally it is allowed to fully ripen and turn crimson red. Originating in Mexico, the jalapeño is a cultivar of the species Capsicum annuum, which usually grows as a bush about 60–120 cm (24–47 in) tall. It is named after Xalapa, Veracruz, where it was traditionally cultivated. About 160 km2 (40,000 acres) are dedicated for the cultivation in Mexico, primarily in the Papaloapan River basin in the center of the state of Veracruz and in the Delicias, Chihuahua, area. Jalapeños are cultivated on smaller scales in Jalisco, Nayarit, Sonora, Sinaloa, and Chiapas. Jalapeño juice is often used as a remedy for seasonal allergies and cardiovascular problems.", picture_file_name: "jalapeno_chile__311182.jpg", picture_content_type: "image/jpeg", picture_file_size: 5933, picture_updated_at: "2015-05-07 07:34:34"},
  {name: "Cilantro (Coriander)", description: "From Wikipedia: Different people may perceive the taste of coriander leaves differently. Those who like it say it has a refreshing, lemony or lime-like flavor, while those who dislike it have a strong aversion to its taste and smell, likening it to that of soap and bugs. Twin studies have shown that 80% of identical twins shared the same preference for the herb, but fraternal twins agreed only about half the time, strongly suggesting a genetic component to the preference. In a genetic survey of nearly 30,000 people, two genetic variants linked to perception of coriander have been found, the most common of which is a gene involved in sensing smells. The gene, OR6A2, lies within a cluster of olfactory-receptor genes, and encodes a receptor that is highly sensitive to aldehyde chemicals. Flavor chemists have found that the coriander aroma is created by a half-dozen or so substances, and most of these are aldehydes. Those who dislike the taste are sensitive to the offending unsaturated aldehydes, while simultaneously may also be unable to detect the aromatic chemicals that others find pleasant. Association between its taste and several other genes, including a bitter-taste receptor, have also been found.", picture_file_name: "Cilantro.jpg", picture_content_type: "image/jpeg", picture_file_size: 88798, picture_updated_at: "2015-05-07 07:37:42"}
